# Cooking App RESTful admin frontend

This software is based on [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) framework.

The application is developed to work with java-based [Cooking Api Enpdoint](https://github.com/fankandin/cooking-app-endpoint).

> Based on Vue.js.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8081
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

```

## Todos
1. Process and display error responses. Now the app just ingores HTTP error statuses and continues to work.
